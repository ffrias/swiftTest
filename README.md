# Swift Test App

This is a simple iOS App coded in swift 1.2 with the intention of showing common iOS development aproaches, and the use of well known Frameworks.

The app hits an Apple webservice and retrives the songs aviables to buy in itunes. It has a searchBar where you can insert a term to query the webservice.
